## Part A:
In 2003, a haircut at a hairdresser costs exactly 10 euros.

Each year the price increases by 2 percent.

Calculate what the price will be in 2023 using JavaScript.

## Task part B:
What is the price in 2023 if the price increases by 3 percent per year since 2003?

What is the price in 2023 if the price increases by 4 percent per year since 2003?

What is the price in 2023 if the price increases by 5 percent per year since 2003?

## Task part C:
Try to write your program in such a way that you can calculate the price of a haircut with as little effort as possible if there are further percentage changes in part B. 

Tip: Use variables whenever possible.
