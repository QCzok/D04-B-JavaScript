Calculate the price of an order with JavaScript.

## Part A:
You are in a restaurant with John, Chuck and Sam.

You order a burger for €5.89. 

John orders a pizza for €4.50 and Sam orders a beer for €2. 

Now use a voucher worth 3 euros. 

In addition, you pay a 10 percent tip and 7 percent taxes.

## Task part B:
What is the price of the order if you pay a 15 percent tip?

What is the price of the order if you pay a 20 percent tip?

## Task part C:
Try to write your program in such a way that you can recalculate the price of the order in the event of further percentage changes in part B with as little effort as possible. 

Tip: Use variables whenever possible.
