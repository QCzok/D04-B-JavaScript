# delivery

## task
You work in the department of a delivery company.

Your delivery vehicle is filled with 10 packages. 

As long as you still have packages, you deliver one.

If you have 5 packages left, you take a break.
1. Find a variable for the number of packages.
2. Write a loop in which you deliver packages as long as you still have any.
3. A package is delivered by writing the console output "package delivered".
4. Take a break by writing the console output "I'm taking a break".

Tipp: you need to check if it's time for a break inside of the loop.

Your result should look like this:
