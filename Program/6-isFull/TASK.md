# isFull

## Task part 1
We want to store up to three people in an array.

The array represents the three participants joining a conference room.

But we want to ensure, that the room won't be overcrowded.

For that purpose a variable will stop the third user joining, if there is only two lines available.

The variable will be named isFull with a value of true or false. 
1. Write a variable named isFull and set it to false (the space is open for new users).
2. Write an array with the users "John Smith" and "Bob Tyler".
3. Now write an if-statement for the third user "Chuck".
4. "Chuck Peterson" can only join the room if there is space left. In that case write a console output with all users.
5. Otherwise write the console output "sorry, the room is already full" instead.

## Task part 2
Now change the value of the variable isFull to true.

How does the result change now?
