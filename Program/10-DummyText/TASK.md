# dummyText

## Task part 1
We want to generate a text with a jumble of letters with at least 500 characters.
1. Write a variable named myRandomText and the value "abc".
2. Now write a loop.
3. The loop is running until the text reaches a minimum length of 500 characters.
4. As the loop runs, it appends the letters "a" "b" and "c" to the variable.
5. When the loop finishes, it outputs the finished text.

## Task part 2
The text should now be at least 50,000 characters long.
How long does the program take to run?
