# isLoggedIn

## Task part 1
We want to check if a user is logged in.
To do this, we create a variable isLoggedIn and store the value true (for logged in) and false (for logged out).
1. Create a variable called isLoggedIn and fill it with the value false (logged out).
2. Write an if-statement.
3. If the user is logged out, write a console output with the text "Please log in".
4. If the user is logged in, write a console output with the text "You are successfully logged in".

## Task part 2
Now change the value of your variable to true (logged in) and check if your case query is now writing the second console output.
