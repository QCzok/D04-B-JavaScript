# Counter

## Task - Part 1
Write a function that calculates the sum of all numbers from 0 to 100.

So the result of the function should be the sum of 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 100.

Tip: A while loop will help you with the calculation.

Important: The function returns the result to the callee.

## Task - part 2
Let's make the function more interesting.

With two parameters, a user can define the range of numbers himself.

For example, a user can pass the numbers 100 and 200 to calculate the sum 100 + 101 + 102 + ... + 200.
