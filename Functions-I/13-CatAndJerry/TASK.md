# TomAndJerry

## Task
A cat named 'Tom' should be able to meow, catch a mouse 'Jerry' and climb a tree.

To do this, we want to write three functions for Tom.

## Preparation
Write a variable isMouseAlive and set the value to true. 

This is how we know if Jerry is dead. 

After Tom catches Jerry, the value of the variable changes to false.

## Task - Part 1
Write a function for Tom to meow.

In the function, you can print a console output with the text "Meow, meow, meow".

## Task - part 2
Write a function for Tom to catch Jerry.

In the function you set the variable isMouseAlive to false.

## Task - Part 3
Write a function for Tom to climb a tree.

The following should happen in the function:
A) If Jerry is alive, write the console output: "Tom hides from Jerry".
B) If Jerry is dead, write the console output: "Tom is resting".
